# Cubic_Zhuffle

This repository will be where all uploads of the scripts for "Cubic Zhuffle" Franchise will be held.

As the summer of 2022 goes on I plan on making a remaster of the original 2021 "tech demo" of Cubic Zhuffle (Cubic Zhuffle: Reshuffled),
and the long awaited sequel "Cubic Zhuffle 2".

I plan on adding 20 levels, Physics Options, and player customization.


I also want to use this project of to help me better utilize Unity, and Github in a more professional manner.
Thanks for reading!


The tech demo of Cubic Zhuffle is available on this github already feel free to play it
